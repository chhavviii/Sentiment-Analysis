# 💬 Text Sentiment Analysis Web App

A Machine Learning–based **Text Sentiment Analysis** application that predicts whether a given text expresses **Positive or Negative sentiment**.  
The project combines **NLP preprocessing, TF-IDF feature extraction, classical ML models**, and a **Streamlit web interface** for real-time predictions.
